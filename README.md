Anymatix Beta
=============

macOS (Apple Silicon)
---------------------

The app is not signed yet, so we need to use a script to remove the quarantine flag. There is a zip containing a script that does it. Here are the super-simplified instructions.


1. Click to download:

	https://github.com/Anymatix/anymatix-beta/releases/download/v1.0.0-beta.1/anymatix-1.0.0-beta.1-bundle.zip


2. Do not open the zip or uncompress it. Open terminal and copy paste (replace "Downloads" if you downloaded it in a different directory):
	```
	cd ~/Downloads && unzip -o anymatix-1.0.0-beta.1-bundle.zip && bash ./install.sh
	```
 
3. When the DMG opens, drag Anymatix to Applications (first launch: rightâ€‘click > Open if Gatekeeper warns).

Windows
-------
Download the setup executable from:
https://github.com/Anymatix/anymatix-beta/releases/download/v1.0.0-beta.1/anymatix-1.0.0-beta.1-setup.exe

Install (2 steps):
1. Run the EXE
2. If SmartScreen warns, More info -> Run anyway (first time only)

Updates
-------
Re-download the new release and repeat the same steps; user data persists.


Nothing else is required.
